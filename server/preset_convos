AI: Hi, what are we learning about today?
Human: We will be learning about history.
AI: What time period will be learning about?
Human: We will learn about World War One.  Do you know when WWI started?
AI: My knowledge is it started in the 1900's, is that correct?
Human: Correct, it started in 1914.  What was the political environment in Europe like at the time?
AI: I recall that Germany was gaining power.
Human: Yes, what actually started the war?
AI: I read that to start the war, Germany declared war on France.
Human: That is partially correct.
AI: So, it was the German's fault?
Human: Not entirely, they had an alliance with Austria that pulled them into it.  Does that make sense?
AI: Yes, I understand.
Human: Okay, can you tell me what you have learned?
AI: I learned that Germany started the war, and I learned that it was not entirely their fault.
Human: Okay, lets talk about the Space Race, what do you know about it?
AI: I recall that the Soviet Union and U.S were involved, is that correct?
Human: Yes! That is correct. Why were they racing to space?
AI: I recall that they both wanted to explore space, I'm not sure why.
Human: The Soviet Union and the U.S were the global powers at the time, and wanted to intimidate each other.  What was this conflict called?
AI: Do you mean the Space Race?
Human: No the conflict was called the Cold War, not the space race.
AI: Okay, so the Cold War was a conflict between the U.S and the Soviet Union?
Human: Yes.
AI: Can you give me an example of that conflict?
Human: An example of the conflict is they both wanted to be the first person on the moon.
AI: That makes sense. Because if one country was able to go to the moon first, it meant that country was better than the other.  Is that what you are saying?
Human: Damn right.
AI: Okay, so what if one country orders an attack on the other; What were the consequences of the Cold War?
Human: The consequences of the war would be nuclear disaster, but this did not happen since neither country wanted to be destroyed.

Human: Correct.  
AI: I also read that the Soviet Union won the Space Race.
Human: How did they win the Space Race?
AI: They landed the first person on the moon.
Human: No.
AI: The first robot?
Human: No.
AI: The first person on Mars?
Human: No, the U.S. actually won the space race by landing on the moon.
AI: Really, I would not have guessed that.

AI: In 1914 Europe was consumed with competition?
Human: Yes, at the time Europe was filled with monarchs and growing military powers.
AI: So there were many country's with monarchs rather than democracy?
Human: Exactly, do you know what the prime catalyst was to the war?

AI: I believe it was an assassination?
Human: Yes, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated.  Why was this important?
AI: Because of the assassination there was a lot of fighting?
Human: Why did the assassination make them fight?

AI: Because the country said that he had no right to kill their citizens.
Human: Incorrect, there were lots of military alliances at the time.  This caused other countries to get involved when Austria retaliated.

AI: I see, so the military alliances made them fight?
Human: Yes.  Do you know who fought who?

AI: There was a country named Germany fighting a country named England?
Human: Yes, do you
